# crosshatch.js

Manage #! URLs

[Check out a very simple demo](http://jimmybyrum.com/crosshatch.js/demo/)

## Usage

 * include crosshatch.js
 * define urls (in urls.js in my example)
 * call Crosshatch.ready();

## What would I use it for?

 * Makes all bits of a webapp bookmarkable and linkable
 * Back/Forward buttons function as expected

## Future features

 * manage the built-in history object to provide the same functionality, but without the #!

## Why #! ?
